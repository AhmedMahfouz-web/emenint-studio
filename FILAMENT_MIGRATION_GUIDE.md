### Performance Optimization
- Widget queries are optimized with proper relationships
- Tables use pagination and search indexing

### Support
- Check Laravel logs in `storage/logs/` for detailed error information
- Verify database connections and migrations are up to date
- Ensure all required Composer packages are installed

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to production environment
2. Train users on new Filament interface
3. Monitor performance and user feedback
4. Plan additional feature enhancements
